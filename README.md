# Introduction To Data Science

## B.Tech. III Year I Semester

## Course Objectives:<br/>
1.  Learn concepts, techniques and tools they need to deal with various facets of data science   practice, including data collection and integration
2.  Understand the basic types of data and basic statistics
3.  Identify the importance of data reduction and data visualization techniques

## Course Outcomes:  After completion of the course, the student should be able to
1.	Understand basic terms what Statistical Inference means. Identify probability distributions commonly used as foundations for statistical modelling.
2.  Fit a model to data
3.  describe the data using various statistical measures
4.  utilize R elements for data handling
5.  perform data reduction and apply visualization techniques.
